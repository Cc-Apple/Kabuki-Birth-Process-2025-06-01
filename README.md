# Kabuki-Birth-Process-2025-06-01
**2025-06-01 (iPhone 15 Pro-Ghost)**   First signs of the *Kabuki birth process*. Resident SiriSearchFeedback, triald, and BackgroundShortcutRunner observed, with tamper traces in EraseDevice, logd, and DroopCount. Evidence shows self-repair + dual-storage falsification, marking Proposition II of Kabuki’s evolution.
# Kabuki Birth Process - 2025-06-01 (Proposition II)

## Context
- **Date focus:** 2025-06-01  
- **Device:** iPhone 15 Pro-Ghost (disposed 2025-06-23 20:00 UTC+7)  
- **Phase:** From Pegasus → Kabuki  
- **Position:** Proposition II in the Kabuki birth timeline  

## Key Findings
- First confirmed signs of the *Kabuki birth process*.  
- Resident processes observed: **SiriSearchFeedback**, **triald**, **BackgroundShortcutRunner**.  
- Tamper traces: **EraseDevice**, **logd**, **DroopCount**.  
- Behavior indicates **self-repair + dual-storage falsification**, not simple deletion.  
- *usageClientId* convergence hints at later unification of Ghost and mini devices.  

## Significance
- Demonstrates Kabuki was not a one-off infection, but an **evolving model**.  
- This day marks the **seed stage**, laying groundwork for later events (6/23 Ghost disposal, 6/28 mini-1 ID fusion).  
- Evidence suggests the device itself was treated as a **training model**, not just a victim.  

## Evidence
- CSV: `EVENTS.csv`, `PIVOT.csv`, `GAPS.csv`  
- PDF: Summary reports  
- PNG: Screenshots with SHA256 fixed  
- DOCX: Draft reports, templates  
- Chain-of-custody: `filenames.txt`, `sizes.txt`, `sha256sum.txt`, `manifest_anti_tamper_scan.csv`

## Verification
```bash
sha256sum -c sha256sum.txt
